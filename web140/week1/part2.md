# GitHub Setup Assignment

## **Objective**
Learn how to create a GitHub account, repository, and folder structure so that you are ready to upload your web project files later.

---

## **Part 1: Create a GitHub Account**
1. Go to **https://github.com**  
2. Sign up with a valid email address  
3. Verify your account through the email GitHub sends you  

---

## **Part 2: Create a Repository**
1. Once logged in, click **“New repository”**  
2. Name your repository:  
   **yourusername.github.io**  
   *(Replace **yourusername** with your actual GitHub username — this is required for GitHub Pages.)*  
3. Add a short description (optional)  
4. Select **Public**  
5. Check **Initialize this repository with a README**  
6. Click **Create repository**

## **Part 3: Create a Project Folder**
1. Inside your repository, click **Add file → Create new file**  
2. In the filename box, type:  
   **web140/placeholder.txt**  
   - GitHub will automatically create a folder named **web140**  
   - The *placeholder.txt* file is temporary (students may delete it later when uploading real project files)  
3. Commit the new file to save the folder structure  

---

## **Part 4: Verify Your Folder Structure**
1. Go to your repository  
2. Confirm that the **web140** folder is visible  
3. Take a screenshot showing the repository with the folder structure
