# Assignment: Personal Portfolio Webpage (DO NOT Change Structure)

## **Objective**
You will customize the provided HTML portfolio template by adding **your personal information**, **your photo**, and **your project details**, while keeping the HTML structure and classes exactly the same.  
This ensures you learn how to update content safely without breaking the layout.

---

## **What You ARE Allowed to Change**
You should **replace only the placeholder content**, including:

### **1. Hero Section**
- `[Student Name]` → replace with **your full name**
- `[Course Name]` → replace with your course title (ex: *WEB140 – Web Development I*)

### **2. About Section**
Replace:
- The profile image URL with **your own image**  
  (You can upload a jpg/png to the project folder or use an online image link.)
- `[Your Name]` in the paragraph with your actual name
- The two paragraphs with personal information such as:
  - Your background  
  - Why you are taking this course  
  - Your interests in web/tech/design

### **3. Projects Section**
You may **rename only the button text** to your project titles *if you prefer*, but:
- **Do not remove any buttons**
- **Do not rename the classes or data-assignment attributes**
- **Do not change their order**
- **Do not delete the Google Sites optional button**

Examples of acceptable edits:
- “HTML, CSS & JavaScript Webpage” → “My HTML/CSS Website”
- “Color Theory Project” → “Color Project (Week 2)”

---

## **What You Are NOT Allowed to Change**
To keep the template functional, **do NOT modify:**
- The folder structure  
- Any class names (`navbar`, `hero`, `about-section`, etc.)  
- Any `id` names (`about`, `projects`)  
- Any JavaScript attributes (`data-assignment`)  
- Linked CSS file (`style.css`)
- Linked JavaScript file (`script.js`)
- Navigation structure
- Button types or number of buttons

In short:
> **Only update the text and image, not the structure.**

---

## **Submission Requirements**
Submit the following:

1. **Your edited HTML file** (same filename)
2. **Your updated image** (if you added a custom profile photo)
3. A **link to your GitHub repository** containing:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `script.js`
   - any images you used

---

## **Grading Criteria**
You will be graded on:

- ✔ Correct replacement of all placeholder text  
- ✔ Including your own profile image  
- ✔ Keeping the structure exactly the same  
- ✔ All sections remain visible and functional  
- ✔ All project buttons remain in place  
- ✔ Clean formatting and spelling  

---

## **Important Reminder**
**Do NOT delete or rearrange anything in the template.**  
Breaking the structure will cause your JavaScript to fail, and points will be deducted.
