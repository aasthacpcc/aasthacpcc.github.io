# Advanced Web Typography Assignment

---

## **Objective**

Practice designing multiple web mockups using different typography combinations. Understand how font choice, pairing, and hierarchy affect readability, visual appeal, and mood.

---

## **Instructions**

### **Part 1 — Create Multiple Mockups**

1. Create a single HTML page (`index.html`).
2. Include **four separate mockup sections** on the same page. Each mockup should demonstrate a unique typography combination:

   * Mockup 1: Heading, Subheading, Paragraph, Navigation
   * Mockup 2: Different font combination
   * Mockup 3: Another combination
   * Mockup 4: Another combination
3. Use **Google Fonts** or system fonts. Each mockup should clearly show the different font pairings.

---

### **Part 2 — Style Each Mockup**

* Use **external CSS (`style.css`)** or `<style>` in the `<head>`.
* Example CSS properties to consider:

  * `font-family`
  * `font-size`
  * `font-weight`
  * `line-height`
  * `letter-spacing`
  * `text-align`
* Each mockup should have a visual container (like a card) to separate it from the others.

---

### **Part 3 — Interactive Font Switching (Optional)**

* Add **buttons** to each mockup to allow switching font combinations using JavaScript (`script.js`).
* Students can experiment with different font pairings without changing the CSS manually.

---

### **Part 4 — Submit Your Typography Table**

1. Create a **table in `index.html`** summarizing each mockup:

   * Mockup #
   * Fonts used for Heading, Subheading, Paragraph, Navigation
   * Explanation for each choice
   * Mood or tone created by the combination
2. This table should clearly show **your rationale for all font decisions**.

Example Table Format:

| Mockup # | Heading Font      | Subheading Font | Paragraph Font | Navigation Font | Rationale                              | Mood/Tone            |
| -------- | ----------------- | --------------- | -------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1        | Libre Baskerville | Poppins         | Roboto         | Montserrat      | Heading is elegant, paragraph readable | Professional & clean |
| 2        | Lobster           | Raleway         | Open Sans      | Poppins         | Playful combination                    | Creative & modern    |

---

### **Part 5 — Submission**

* Submit **all files** in a folder:

  * `index.html` (with mockups and table)
  * `style.css`
  * `script.js` (optional)
* Ensure the page displays correctly in a browser.

---

## **Tips for Students**

* Focus on **contrast and readability**.
* Consider **font hierarchy** (headings vs. paragraphs).
* Each mockup should look like a **mini real webpage section**.
* Document **why fonts were chosen** and how they complement each other.
* Use **interactive buttons** to explore combinations if implemented.

---

This assignment encourages students to **experiment with font pairings**, **observe hierarchy**, and **justify typography choices** while providing a clear visual presentation of their decisions.
