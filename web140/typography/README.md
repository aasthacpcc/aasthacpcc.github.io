# Advanced Web Typography Assignment

---

## Objective

Practice designing multiple web mockups using different typography combinations. Understand how font choice, pairing, and hierarchy affect readability, visual appeal, and mood.

---

## Instructions

### Part 1 — Create Multiple Mockups

1. Create a single HTML page (`index.html`).
2. Include **four separate mockup sections** on the same page. Each mockup should demonstrate a unique typography combination:

   * Mockup 1: Heading, Subheading, Paragraph, Navigation
   * Mockup 2: Different font combination
   * Mockup 3: Another combination
   * Mockup 4: Another combination
3. Use **Google Fonts** or system fonts. Each mockup should clearly show the different font pairings.

---

### Part 2 — Style Each Mockup

* Use **external CSS (`style.css`)** or `<style>` in the `<head>`.
* Example CSS properties to consider:

  * `font-family`
  * `font-size`
  * `font-weight`
  * `line-height`
  * `letter-spacing`
  * `text-align`
* Each mockup should have a visual container (like a card) to separate it from the others.

---

### Part 3 — Interactive Font Switching (Optional)

* Add **buttons** to each mockup to allow switching font combinations using JavaScript (`script.js`).
* Students can experiment with different font pairings without changing the CSS manually.

---

### Part 4 — Explanation

* Below each mockup, add a short paragraph or HTML comment explaining:

  * Why you chose each font combination
  * How the fonts complement each other
  * What mood or style the combination conveys

Example:

```html
<!--
Mockup 1:
Heading: Libre Baskerville — elegant and strong
Subheading: Poppins — modern contrast
Paragraph: Roboto — readable body text
Navigation: Montserrat — clear and stylish
Mood: Professional and clean
-->
```

---

### Part 5 — Submission

* Submit **all files** in a folder:

  * `index.html`
  * `style.css`
  * `script.js` (optional)
* Ensure the page displays correctly in a browser.

## Grading Criteria

| Criteria                                      | Points |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Four distinct mockups with different fonts    | 4      |
| Font pairings show intentional design choices | 4      |
| Explanations are clear and reflective         | 2      |
| Overall layout is clean and readable          | 2      |

**Total: 12 points**

## Tips for Students

* Focus on **contrast and readability**.
* Consider **font hierarchy** (headings vs. paragraphs).
* Use **Google Fonts** for a wide variety of options.
* Each mockup should look like a mini real webpage section.
* Experiment with **color and spacing** to enhance typography impact.

This assignment encourages students to **experiment, observe, and justify typography choices** while providing an interactive element to see multiple combinations quickly.
